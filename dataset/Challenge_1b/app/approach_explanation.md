Approach Explanation for Round 1B
Overview
This solution extends the Round 1A PDF outline extractor to address Round 1B's requirements for persona-driven document intelligence. It processes a collection of 3–10 PDFs, extracts relevant sections and subsections based on a persona and job-to-be-done, and outputs a structured JSON file. The solution is modular, efficient, and adheres to the constraints: CPU-only, model size ≤ 1GB, processing time ≤ 60 seconds, and no internet access.
Methodology

PDF Processing and Outline Extraction:

Reuses Round 1A modules (pdf_processor.py, heading_detector.py, output_handler.py) to extract document titles and headings (H1, H2, H3) with page numbers.
Uses PyMuPDF for efficient text block extraction, leveraging bounding box coordinates to map headings to their positions.


Semantic Analysis:

Keyword Extraction: Extracts top keywords from the job-to-be-done using TF-IDF with NLTK to identify relevant terms (e.g., "methodology" for a literature review).
Relevance Ranking: Computes relevance scores using sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, ~80MB) to calculate cosine similarity between section/subsection text and the job description.
Subsection Summarization: Uses sumy (LSA summarizer) to generate concise "refined text" for subsections, ensuring relevance to the job-to-be-done.


Section and Subsection Extraction:

Extracts section text by clipping page regions between consecutive headings or page boundaries using PyMuPDF.
Splits section text into paragraphs (subsections) based on double newlines, filtering out short or irrelevant text.-pass
Ranks sections and subsections by relevance scores, assigning importance ranks from 1 to N.


Output Generation:

Produces a JSON file (output.json) with metadata (input documents, persona, job, timestamp), extracted sections (document, page, title, rank), and subsection analysis (document, page, refined text, rank).
Saves Round 1A-style outline JSONs for each PDF as a byproduct.



Libraries and Models

PyMuPDF: For PDF parsing and text extraction (~50MB).
sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2): For embedding-based relevance scoring (~80MB).
sumy: For lightweight text summarization (~10MB).
NLTK: For keyword extraction (~10MB with punkt data).
NumPy, scikit-learn: For numerical operations and similarity computation.
Total model size: ~150MB, well within the 1GB limit.

Optimizations

Efficiency: Processes only relevant page regions, uses lightweight models, and caches embeddings to meet the 60-second processing time for 3–5 documents.
Modularity: Separates PDF processing, heading detection, semantic analysis, and output handling into distinct modules for reusability.
Offline Operation: Pre-downloads all models and NLTK data during Docker build, ensuring no internet access is required.
Generalizability: Handles diverse domains (research papers, financial reports, textbooks) and personas by relying on semantic similarity rather than domain-specific rules.

Docker Execution
The solution runs in a Docker container (linux/amd64) with the command:
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/input:/app/input -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output --network none mysolutionname:somerandomidentifier

It processes all PDFs in /app/input, reads config.json for persona and job, and outputs output.json in /app/output.
Future Improvements

Add multilingual support using sentence-transformers multilingual models (e.g., distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v2, ~200MB) for bonus points.
Optimize for parallel processing using multiprocessing to leverage 8 CPUs.
Enhance subsection extraction by incorporating subheading hierarchies (H2, H3) more explicitly.

This approach ensures high section and subsection relevance, meets all constraints, and provides a robust foundation for further rounds.
